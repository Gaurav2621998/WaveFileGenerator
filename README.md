# WaveFileGenerator
WaveFileGenerator class generates a .wav file in main dirctory for a given frequency.<br>
Please check the log "pathcheck" for path of the generated file.<br>

I have set the WaveFileGenerator class variables after going through these few links .<br>

http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/ <br>

You could change the variables as per your need.<br>

There's just 1 function in the WaveFileGenerator class i.e 
```
public File getWavFile() //This returns the File object of the generated wave file.
```
